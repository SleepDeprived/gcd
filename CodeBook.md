###Each record contains:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



###Cleaning data:
The following files were combined to produce a single data frame:

- X_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- subject_test.txt
- X_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_train.txt

The combined data frame had no missing values and all values were between the normalized range of -1 and 1 described by the authors of the source files.

###Data manipulation:
The mean and standard deviation of each row was calculated
